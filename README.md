# opentbs-tool
Simplistic command line interface for [OpenTBS](https://github.com/Skrol29/opentbs). It currently depends on the fork [OpenTBS@rotdrop](https://github.com/rotdrop/opentbs).

The idea is to pass an office document and a data-file (probably JSON) to the tool and let it do the substitutions. See http://www.tinybutstrong.com/opentbs.php for further information about OpenTBS.
